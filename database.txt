Notes on SQL

Relational databases:
use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data
MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL

NoSQL databases:
designed for large-scale
store massive amts of unstructured data in document, key-value, or graph formats

Object-oriented databases:
store complex data structures such as objects with methods and attributes
db4o and ObjectDB

Columnar databases:
store data in columns rather than rows and are optimized for querying large datasets
with complex queries
data warehousing and business intelligence applications where performance is critical
Apache Cassandra and Amazon Redshift

Time-series databases:
handle large volumes of time-series data, such as data from sensors or financial transactions
optimized for handling data that is continuously generated over time and are often used in
Internet of Things (IoT) and financial applications
InfluxDB and OpenTSDB

Document databases:
store data in a semi-structured format, such as JSON or XML, and are often used in
web applications where data is generated dynamically
handle unstructured data and are widely used in content management
systems or e-commerce applications
MongoDB and Couchbase

Graph databases:
store data in a graph format, with nodes representing entities and edges
representing relationships between them
optimized for querying complex, connected data and are often used in social networks,
recommendation engines, and fraud detection applications
Neo4j and ArangoDB

Exercise:

Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:

a. What is the current quantity in stock for each product?

b. What is the total cost and revenue for each sale?

c. Which products have a quantity in stock less than 10?

Write SQL queries to update the database for the following scenarios:

a. A new product has been added to the inventory

b. A supplier's contact information has changed

c. A sale has been made and the quantity in stock for the corresponding product needs
to be updated

In SQLite and other SQL database systems, the REAL data type is used to store
floating-point numbers, which represent numbers with decimal points

    NN: Not Null Constraint
        Indicates that a column cannot contain NULL values. It enforces that every row in the table must have a value for this column.
        Example: column_name INT NOT NULL

    PK: Primary Key Constraint
        Indicates that a column or a combination of columns uniquely identifies each row in the table. It enforces uniqueness and provides fast access to rows.
        Example: column_name INT PRIMARY KEY

    AI: Auto-Increment Property
        Typically used in conjunction with the Primary Key Constraint. It automatically generates a unique value for the column whenever a new row is inserted into the table.
        Example: id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT

    U: Unique Constraint
        Ensures that all values in the column are unique (except for NULL values, unless the column also has a NOT NULL constraint).
        Example: column_name INT UNIQUE

    Integer:
        Integer data type stores whole numbers without decimal points.
        Integers can be signed or unsigned, indicating whether they can represent negative values or not.
        Examples of integer data types include INT, INTEGER, SMALLINT, BIGINT, etc.
        Integer data types have a fixed size, which typically depends on the specific implementation and platform. For example, INT usually represents a 32-bit signed integer.

    Number:
        "Number" is a more generic term and can refer to various numeric data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, decimals, etc.
        In some SQL databases, such as Oracle, the NUMBER data type is used to store numeric values that can have decimal points or fractional parts.
        The NUMBER data type in Oracle allows you to specify precision (total number of digits) and scale (number of digits to the right of the decimal point) for the numeric values.
        Unlike integers, numbers can represent both whole numbers and values with decimal points.
        Example: NUMBER(10,2) indicates a numeric value with a total of 10 digits, with 2 digits to the right of the decimal point.
