use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data
MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL

NoSQL databases:
designed for large-scale
store massive amts of unstructured data in document, key-value, or graph formats

Object-oriented databases:
store complex data structures such as objects with methods and attributes
db4o and ObjectDB

Columnar databases:
store data in columns rather than rows and are optimized for querying large datasets
with complex queries
data warehousing and business intelligence applications where performance is critical
Apache Cassandra and Amazon Redshift

Time-series databases:
handle large volumes of time-series data, such as data from sensors or financial transactions
optimized for handling data that is continuously generated over time and are often used in
Internet of Things (IoT) and financial applications
InfluxDB and OpenTSDB

Document databases:
store data in a semi-structured format, such as JSON or XML, and are often used in
web applications where data is generated dynamically
handle unstructured data and are widely used in content management
systems or e-commerce applications
MongoDB and Couchbase

Graph databases:
store data in a graph format, with nodes representing entities and edges
representing relationships between them
optimized for querying complex, connected data and are often used in social networks,
recommendation engines, and fraud detection applications
Neo4j and ArangoDB
